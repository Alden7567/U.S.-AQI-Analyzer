# Project Summary

My Colleague and I developed a program to analyze air pollution data in the U.S. from 2000 to 2021, allowing users to compare states and examine the Air Quality Index (AQI) for four pollution types. Users can either compare top-polluting states in a selected year or view AQI trends for an individual state over time, with results visualized in bar graphs. To fit our scope, we processed the dataset to calculate yearly AQI averages per state, focusing on O3, CO, SO2, and NO2 pollution levels. This program helps illustrate pollution trends over two decades, aiding environmentalists in identifying states with hazardous pollution levels.
